# Calendar Analytics Web App
# test

This repository provides a standalone web application that analyzes your Google
Calendar and produces statistics on the most frequent meetings. It can
highlight meetings with specific groups such as executive team members,
Gartner analysts, or direct reports.

## Setup

1. In the Google Cloud Console create a project and enable the **Google
   Calendar API**.
2. Under **APIs & Services → Credentials**:
   - Configure an OAuth consent screen. When prompted for scopes, add
     `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.readonly` so the app can read
     your calendar events.
   - Create an OAuth client ID for a Web application. Add
     `http://localhost:8080` as an authorized JavaScript origin.
   - Create an API key.
3. Edit `app.js` and replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` and `YOUR_API_KEY` with your own
   credentials.
4. Optionally edit `config.json` to specify emails for key groups:

```json
{
  "exec_team": ["ceo@example.com", "cfo@example.com"],
  "gartner_analysts": ["analyst@example.com"],
  "direct_reports": ["report1@example.com"]
}
```

## Run

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start a local server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. Navigate to <http://localhost:8080> in your browser and click **Refresh
   Stats**.

The application uses your existing Google account session and runs entirely in
the browser; no server-side component is required.
